# Python-Neural-Network-Classification
Python Neural Network that classifies through the training database the type of flower (Iris).

This code example is from a Python classifying neural network with 3 different outputs, which informs which type of (Iris) out of the three is correct, taking into account the database used for training.

The database presents three types of (Iris) which can be (Iris setosa), (Iris virginica) or (Iris versicolor).

As for the Neural network, it has 4 inputs, two hidden layers with 8 neurons each, an output layer with three neurons, normal weight initialization function, 'relu' and 'softmax' activation function, and uses as optimizer the ' Adam '.

Curiosity:
To improve the neural network one has to test several values that the 'Keras' library offers, so it is advisable to study cross-validation.
